#Verified donations so far ~INR 700K


#Huge shout out to all donors! This is brilliant! Couple of updates:

1. Dear /u/TheBeginnerr, you have donated enough. Don't bankrupt yourself. The rest of us can continue contributions. No one will think any less of you if you didn't match exact 3x of upvotes.

2. If you post screenshot of your donation (please make sure you hide personal details, transaction ID, bank details etc.) then /u/root_su will gild you. Just our way of saying thanks. We know donating to the cause has higher precedence right now. This is gold credit he already has. Not buying gold right now. 

3. If you have medium of donation that works well for people currently outside India, then please share as a reply to this comment (and tag me). I will update this comment.

**Context:** More than 324 people have died in the worst flooding in nearly a century in the south Indian state of Kerala.

Roads are damaged, mobile phone networks are down, an international airport has been closed and more than 220,000 people have been left homeless after unusually heavy rain in the past nine days.

Officials repeatedly revised the death toll upwards from 86 people on Friday morning to more than 300 by the evening as a massive rescue operation reached more flood-hit regions. “Around 100 people died in the last 36 hours alone,” a state official said.

Casualty numbers are expected to increase further, with thousands more people still stranded and less intense though still heavy rain forecast for at least the next 24 hours. Many have died from being buried in hundreds of landslides set off by the flooding. ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/17/kerala-floods-death-toll-rescue-effort-india))

**Arm chair lawyers read this:** We do not condone karma whoring. But. Butt. But, this post is infinitely more useful than the 'oh look at this pretty photo (I took or I lifted from the internet)' threads. And about admins, yeah, they need to focus on cleaning reddit and get rid of hateful fucks that pose actual threat against people. They should focus on subs dedicated on harassing people. They should focus on subs accommodating and/or encouraging bigotry in the guise of free speech and/or dark humor. This harmless post, an attempt at raising awareness towards actual suffering of actual people should be fine. It ought to be anyway. </rant>


###edit n: Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.

"|"I'll match your donation, OP

EDIT: Woke up to see this rapidly went out of my *aukaat*, so [here's my meager donation to the cause](https://imgur.com/a/CJykel3). I hope my brothers and sisters from Kerala can forgive me. 

As compensation, I'm going to spend the rest of today and tomorrow volunteering in the collection drives around Hyderabad. If anyone is in town, do come by and drop off anything you can spare. Packaged food, blankets, sanitary pads, and of course water bottles. They never have enough water during the floods. I remember how there were people charging 1000 rupees a bottle during the Uttarakhand floods. 

I will also be asking my friends to donate as much as they can. Cheers and I hope the storm blows over quickly. "|"Was hoping to match OP's amount, but this is fast going out of my *aukaat*. So here's my contribution: https://i.imgur.com/R7E3btm.png
