Bangalore to Mangalore is through the ghat section. What you need to do is book a seat on the Yestwantpur-Karwar (Yestwantpur is in Bangalore) express on a weekday (Friday works best as you would have the weekend to get back). The train starts at 7 AM iirc. Get some sleep as soon as you get in - The train has brand new coaches (LHB rakes) with a push back seat even for 2nd class sitting. And the train is really clean as of now. \n\nBoard the train and get some sleep in till 1030. Then as soon as the train reaches Sakleshpur, go occupy the door (on the right side if going from Bangalore). This is very important because many passengers see the first tunnel and then only decide to run for the doors. So now that you have the right hand side door, for next two hours, enjoy the rainy, green monsoon time western ghats plus 40 tunnels while standing at the door. The scenic ride ends at Subramanya Road, which is the next station. If the train has enough young people, you can hear everyone shouting each time the train enters a tunnel. Super fun it is. Also, many people are stupid enough to sit near the door (With legs dropping outside). Don't do that. First of all, its dumb and unsafe. Secondly, cops will fine you. Cops got hold of one guy when i did this section last year and made an example out of him. Every time the train stops (at a signal), you can get down and take photos. Should not be a problem. But people will be throwing stuff from the train on the side of the tracks. That will be really annoying tho. No way to avoid that , swach bharath n al. \n\nAfter Subramanya road (where many people will get down), you can go to your seat and chill. Either stare outside, see beautiful house and cry that you don't own one of those, or sleep off or read that unfinished book on your bookshelf. The scenery ends at Subramanya road.  You can then either get down at Mangalore, go to Pabba's / Ideal and thulp great ice cream (Gadbad) or go up to Karwar. \n\nMangalore to Karwar is amazing as well. But the problem is , its 6 pm by the time the same train gets to the scenic part and you can't see anything outside because its dark.  However, there won't be anyone in the train. When I went, I was the only guy in my entire compartment for most of the sections from Mangalore to Karwar. The stations in between are great as well (Gokharna is one :) ) and so well maintained. If you want to know more (the Karwar Mangalore section can be done the very next day after chilling in Karwar and eating sea food), let me know. Will write more. \n\nEdit: About the getting down and taking photos part at a signal, the train has stopped because there is a parallel track for another train to pass (built solely for this purpose as its a single line section). So be very careful while doing that. Or don't do it at all. Better safe than sorry. "", ""I've always found both the trains and stations in South India to be extremely clean as compared to those in North India. You can especially see this in the trains, the ones leaving from South India leave clean and as soon as they cross the boundary of Karnataka/Andhra, the process of dirtying them slowly begins. By the time it reaches some station up North, the train is basically a garbage dump/spittoon/vomit bag/whatever else there's left. And when you see trains coming from the North half of India, you see what is basically an unclean mess that won't get cleansed until it hits its South Indian railway yard for it's next clean-to-unclean run northwards.  \n\nMeanwhile, the difference between stations in the North and the South of India is SO FUCKING HUGE that words alone fail to describe it.

It was a long journey, but I struggled like the rest of you. 


- **To all of you who are depressed, unmotivated and in bed all day, I would recommend doing something as simple as taking a shower**. A warm/cold shower (however you prefer) is so underrated and can help you just get ready enough to do do something more, or at least get you out of bed. There have been so many times that my feeling of ‘bleh what a day’ turned around after a shower.


- **Cut out the porn and the jerking off. It’s going to push you into a deeper hole without making you realise that it’s happening at all**.
Masturbation is fine, so is porn. Just don’t indulge to pass the time is all.


- **Small achievements can go a long way. Try and learn how to make a nice omelette for yourself. Re-arrange your cupboard maybe? Re-order your bookshelf? Clean the dirt off your shoes? Water your plants? Any of these is something positive you did for yourself or your household. Congratulations. **


- Depression is very complicated, so there’s no fix all solution as there are infinite reasons that can lead you to this road. I’m going to try and address those who feel unproductive or feel they can’t do much professionally or education wise:

- **A lot of the times, we get depressed because of conflict in fulfilling what’s expected of us and what we actually want to do, my only advice is this: Everyone dies**. **Yes, taking up a job which isn’t mainstream might seem embarrassing in the moment, maybe your parents are upset or worst case disown you. But we’re talking about getting you out of the mindset to take your life or wasting it away.**
**You may push yourself to do something that people/parents or society want but not you, then everyone will die, and you’ll be stuck with your choice for 30-40 years, unhappy. **
I’d rather you risk 5-7 years of discomfort, take a risk, or start at the bottom somewhere and grow and learn. Get beyond the confines of the education system if you suck at it. Live life on your own terms. 

- Also, It helps no one if you want to be a high paid exec but spend your day binging Brooklyn 99 or reruns of Big Bang Theory. __Either adjust your dreams to your effort or your effort to your dreams. A disconnect will only get you down further.__

- Story time: A friend of mine, girl, ran away from her house after she was verbally and physically abused by her family for not getting a job. She was 23 at that time. She had around 19k in savings, walked around and found a job as a night desk attendant after a week in a local chain hotel reception. She managed to find a place to stay with 5 other people in a very (VERY) small flat, so she could pay less rent, she ate shit food and lived in shit conditions, but she learned and grew on the job, by waiting tables and cleaning and doing additional duties. She grew and now she’s managing the hotel and running a bar owned by the owner of the chain on her own and earning more than most people I know at 28-29. This woman would call me almost everyday depressed and crying, to see her where she is now makes me very happy.

- **So yeah, her family hated her, her relatives hated her for being a receptionist** and a dishwasher and a waitress, she risked A LOT for 6-7 years, but she decided to work her ass off out of that situation. 

- **Doing productive work isn’t too hard. You just need some momentum. Try and have no zero days. If you’ve got a shit ton of work piled up, resolve to do some portion of it.**

- Do enough that the future you (of tomorrow, of next week, of next month) can thank the past you for being an awesome bro/sis and doing your part of the load. So no zero productivity days. Feel free to DM. 

**PS: Redditors can at the very most sympathise with you and tell you that everything is going to be okay. Very few would be more generous than words of support. Everyone will move on with their life and in the end, it’s only you and your hustle. Solution takes time and you’ll probably be out of the rut, but it’ll take time. Be patient.**

Also, everyone below saying that they needed this, I urge you to keep sharing your stories. Maybe it does not garner the attention of a lot of redditors,or it gets buried, or maybe you're scared you've not articulated it enough. Keep sharing because sometimes, an individual can help you gain perspective and you may never know where you get the greatest help. Please also use the regular depression and discussion threads.

The first question he was asked as he reached the venue was if he found the 90-minute long commute from the airport to the venue frustrating. Murthy brushed it off saying he\'s used to worse in Bengaluru, his home city.\n\n\n\nIt was a good point to start the conversation since his lecture\'s topic was city systems. Murthy quoted several numbers and international examples to highlight what\'s holding Indian cities back from being world class.\n\n\n\n""The biggest challenge for all of us, not just politicians or bureaucrats, is that we, Indians, have the highest ego per unit of achievement. I would humbly request, we be open-minded to those who have performed better than us,"" he said.\n\n\n\nHe spoke of having worked with so many governments and realised that somehow things don\'t move fast. It\'s partly due to the know-it-all attitude. He shared thatNandan Nilekani(co-founder, Infosys and the force behindAadhaarcards) too had a similar experience while working with the establishment in Delhi.\n\n\n\n""Nandan was giving a lecture on his experience in designing and implementing Aadhaar sometime back. Somebody asked him how difficult was it to work in Delhi,"" Murthy said. Nilekani\'s response: The first hurdle that you come across is that they (bureaucrats) say we know this. The toughest hurdle is if they say we are already doing this. There isn\'t much to do then.\n\n\n\nMurthy contrasted this attitude with his experience as an IT advisor to the Thai PM, more than a decade back. ""They (Thai officials) would make a presentation and I would give suggestions. They would write those down. The next time I went there, they would show me how they\'ve (the suggestions) been implemented,"" he said.\n\n\n\nIn comparison stands the Indian bureaucrat, who as per Murthy never writes anything.

My sister's husband is a follower of some guruji near Vizayanagaram, Andhra pradesh. My sister told that the guruji speaks of himself with the likes of Shiridi Sai, Shankaracharya etc. He seems to have read all the vedantas, gita, what not. 
He has some followers who believe that. 

I have never been there but my sister and her husband visited the ashram two days back and found that the grandson of that guruji was married. He was barely 15 years old. And the bride was not more than 11-12 years old.

I asked why did someone not complain?
My sister said, they married them secretly in the ashram without even taking any photos. So, no proof there as well.
But the bride is living with the groom in the ashram with so called highly educated guruji.

I can't stay calm knowing this. And he may advice his followers to do the same with their children.

**[BJP Manifesto](https://www.bjp.org/en/manifesto2019)**

**[Congress Manifesto](https://manifesto.inc.in/en/)**

The BJP Manifesto is available in Hindi and English, while the Congress Manifesto is available in Hindi, English, Odia, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Punjabi, Assamese.

I've provided a few highlights from both the manifestos. The manifestos are large and it is not possible to cover all the points. I have covered the points which I believe are easier to judge on implementability.

---

# Observations
* Congress manifesto is longer.
* BJP Manifesto doesn't allow to copy text (even though it is a PDF document).

# Highlights of BJP Manifesto

I'm legit scared of what will happen if they have 5 more years [P]	"I've never seen this country so polarized in my lifetime. The anti-muslim venom was hidden under a veneer of development earlier, but now its out in open view. 

There is absolutely no rhetoric about development anymore. No one is even talking about ""Make in India"" or creating jobs. 

It's basically fear mongering and Hindu nationalism. Which is strange because India isn't under attack, nor is it threatened by anything for BJP to say ""Bharat khatre mein hain"" (India is in danger).

I don't want to live in a country like this. And I can't imagine what will happen if they get 5 more years. It took them just 4 years to abandon economic development for religious hatred.

Bus apni pride leke ghoomte raho.', 'You can recover from a financial bankruptcy, not from the moral and ideological bankruptcy.', 'I agree, just one point. Their politico-cultural vision wasn\'t even hidden earlier. BJP has always been clear about where it stands wrt its interpretation of Indian history/culture and the related notion of who is an Indian. Back in 2014, one could find the following under the about party section on their website:\n\n> The Bharatiya Janata Party is today the most prominent member of the family of organisations known as the ""Sangh Parivar"" and nurtured by the Rashtria Swyamsevak Sangh (RSS)... the BJP is wedded to India’s unity and integrity, its intrinsic identity and the social strength, individual character and cultural uniqueness that have been the hallmark of this great country and its people for millennia. History is the philosophy of nations. And the Sangh Parivar has a very clear conception of Indian history. Here was a great civilization whose influence and imprint spread from... It weathered the storms of invaders, from the Greeks to the Huns, from the Shakas to the Islamic armies of Turks and Afghans. It fought and resisted external oppression and its essential civilization and culture survived great challenges and attempts at effacement. The glory of Vijayanagara and the heroism of Maharana Pratap, of a Shivaji and of a Guru Govind Singh are testimony to the Indian spirit. In more recent times this torch of nationalism and Indian identity was carried forward by Swami Dayanand and Swami Vivekanada. And in the present century the good work has been carried on by Sri Aurobindo, Lokmanya Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi and others… It [RSS] believes in the principle of: ""Justice for all and appeasement of none"". It has no doubt about Hindu identity and culture being the mainstay of the Indian nation and of Indian society. This identity and this culture informs all Indians, irrespective of religious or denominational faith. To the RSS, all Indians, irrespective of religious background, notwithstanding their mode and place of worship, are equal.\n\nNote the rhetoric here (appeasement), and the identities being framed as native vs. outsider (invader) here. I don\'t think even those who bought the development rhetoric were totally unaware of these stances of the party. I suspect instead that there\'s a soft Hindutva in the country which views such issues as comprising a cultural stance, not a political one. So while they may not condone violence, they may support soft \'cultural\' issues. Of course in the political realm, there\'s no such thing as culture devoid of politics and vice versa. Once a cultural discourse such as this has been established, it isn\'t surprising to see how it would lead to political polarization, resentment against the so-called outsider/invader, and even violence. \n\n[P.S. the quoted section is something I cited in a paper I wrote for a course back in 2014.

Till the time there is even an iota of resistance present in our society, we have hope. I am confident that democracy is too strong a concept to fall at the hands of Modi and Shah, try as much as they may. \n\nWe should not become silent in the face of barrage of propaganda. Pls remember that till the time people question this propaganda, it will make the lives of these propagandists tougher. Eventually, those who persist will win.

It costed Rs. 180 for each of us.

  I sent them the game as a gift on steam and they sent me RS.180 via freecharge. It was all good and happy. Now total balance around Rs. 650.

  On November 25, when I try to access my freecharge account via my android phone, it shows a notification saying your account has been ""temporarily banned"" and for further information contact ""care@freecharge.com"". I go ahead and email them asking for the reason for why it was banned and to unblock it asap.

  Today, 26 November, I receive a mail saying - 
  >Dear XYZ,

  Wow, brilliant. I'm not even sure what half of it means. Will the freecharge account of redditors from r/IndianGaming receive a refund for Rs. 180? Or will their bank/CC receive it.

  Now the initial Rs. 300 I had was a part of RS. 500 that was sent to me by my friend ABC who had added money to his wallet from his friend PQR who had a credit card. I don't have one. I had transferred some part of 500 to my brother's account, where he used a part of it and returned back the other part.

Now I'm not sure If my friend ABC will receive a refund or will his friend PQR will receive the refund. Don't even know if either of them will receive a refund.

  Being angry af, I started searching for similar issues on google. Many people have faced the same problem of their account being banned and no reason being given to them. 

   After some more research, I found that rooted phone was a common theme. I'm not sure if this is the exact reason or not. But somewhere a person who created a second account on his rooted dual sim phone (After his first account was banned) had his new account blocked in seconds. My OnePlus 2 has been rooted from day 1. I've had freecharge installed since 3 months now. Also how does my phone being rooted matter?

  Lastly, Snapdeal bought Freecharge for $400 million. That amount of money and you don't have a f*cking toll free number. Forget toll free number, at least a normal number where I can call them. Or at least live chat. They reply to emails every 24 hour. 

  Now even If I get all of my money back, this is some next level of shit and I'm never using freecharge again. Also, If I don't, is there something I can do about it? Experienced redditors, help me pls file a consumer complain against them.


**Freecharge, fuck you! Also, as many redditors have pointed out, freecharge usually has shitty customer service and my case is not an exception.**



  **Also remember to share this with people who have ROOTED android phones and have started using freecharge after demonetisation.**

2. https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/59c8ky/np_the_snapdeal_quality_check_scam/

**EDIT 2**: Just found out about a loophole where one can login into a freecharge account without being needed to enter the OTP. Now, I'm no cyber security expert, but it seems like by installing an old Freecharge apk from one of these sites, you don't need to enter the otp.

  This is ridiculous. This [site](http://www.jonomus.net/coupon/freecharge-trick-earn-unlimted-recharge/]) explains how simple it is. Okay, I'm not getting everything about it but there are about 100 sites like this. WTF $400 million freecharge is doing about this? Is this a joke?

**EDIT 3**: Damn, this blew up. Number of upvotes on this post is more than my loss. Some relief lol.

**EDIT 4**: Seems like many redditors were also banned for unknown reasons and their queries were never answered. Freecharge twitter/facebook has not replied to me yet. I haven't even received a reply to my email sent 10 hours ago. They really do reply only once in 24 hours. I still can't comprehend this.

**EDIT 5**:Great news, both u/rebelsoul94 and u/not_the_irrelevant have confirmed they've re received the refund in their accounts, though without any notifications. They'll send it to me again later in  another account, which I will use in 34 milliseconds.  **Still no idea about the other Rs. 300**.

To all the people who complain that they went to shitty 3rd tier colleges that did not teach anything and stuck in a IT job, today you can pretty much learn any skill related to programming online. \n\nI know a guy here in the US, who worked as a truck driver for 15 years, then retired, picked up programming, android app development and now he is learning VR game development for android. He was fucking 40 when he started learning 'if else' statements. \n\nWhy can't all these people who are already in IT spend time to learn and improve from places like coursera "", 'Innovative thinking is something that is just not valued in Indian society. When people go to engineering school to just get the label of being an engineer and so their parents can tout them off as the better bred horse in their neighborhood, the whole point of becoming an engineer is lost. Horrible internet? That\'s not really the issue. The issue is cultural. At engineering schools in the US, the focus is not on memorizing, it\'s really on ""how well can you think outside the box to solve this problem during this 1 hour exam where we KNOW that you won\'t be able to really do much, if at all."" The point is, by continuously forcing you to utilize the engineering knowledge you learn in the classroom to think outside the box, you become naturally creative at problem solving and utilizing the learned formulas and theory in a practical manner. You really have to work to earn your degree...there\'s no other way to get them. (Most) Indians just don\'t care about the knowledge. It\'s simply a means to an end to getting a job and having the status of being an ""engineer."" Innovation isn\'t important because innovation creates risk.

As a startup enthusiast myself, I find it difficult to meet like minded people, I didn\'t get into IIT, am interested and actually working on a product right now, but, when you go to looking at the ground reality, everything in India is fragmented, we don\'t have a concentrated place where people do something (without getting judged by which colleges they passed out of).\n\nI had gone to IITB back in my engg days and in their startup accelerator was a company which taught how to write ""hello world"" java app in a week seminar.\n\nmore students from IIT/IIM (and other colleges too) need to start companies, they might fail and stuff, but there is a dire need.

"# MAJOR EDIT: People, PLEASE, for the love of all that is holy, *write* to your paper! Vernacular papers printing about this will do much, much more than just sending 1 e-mail!

If you haven't heard yet, the TRAI wants to allow telecos to regulate OTT services such as WhatsApp, Skype or Viber. While this does not directly imply that shit has hit the fan, it could allow Telecos to charge you seperately for each WhatsApp message, or make you pay equivalent charges for Skype calls etc.

**Why should I take your word for this?**

Here are some News and editorial articles on this:

1. [medianama](http://www.medianama.com/2015/03/223-should-india-have-licensing-of-internet-services-net-neutrality-trai-wants-your-views/)
2. [Indian Express](http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/trai-seeks-to-regulate-ott-players-like-skype-viber-whatsapp-and-google-talk/)

**Wait, you lied to me! The TRAI wants my opinion on this!**

Yep, if not for the slight fear mongering, half of you would have left scratching your balls. At least you're here now.

**Okay, So what should I do?**

As you've read (and I hope you've read that), the TRAI wants your opinion on this. Shit hasn't hit the fan yet, and we can turn this around before this actually becomes a serious consideration. So, the first thing you can do is to e-mail the TRAI on their comments email, which is : advqos@trai.gov.in
You probably shouldn't copypasta someone else's email on this as it will lead to them beleiving that a few people are spamming their inbox. Some tooltips on what to write would be:

Some tooltips on what to write would be:

 1. Refer to the recent Net Neutrality agitation, and the subsequent FCC ruling,
 2. Talk about how loss of revenue to Telecos should not be the bar to progress,
 3. Talk about how Net Neutrality laws have already been enacted in The Netherlands after a similar agitation there,
 4. If you want to, talk about how rulings in favour of allowing said regulation are anti-development, and not what you expect from the Government.

**What else can I do?**

You can tweet the issue out and raise publicity. Since this ruling affects widely used services such as WhatsApp and Skype, more people should be willing to listen.

**Dude all this takes too long.**

Well, yeah, you can either take 5 minutes now or bitch endlessly later. It's your choice.

**Edit:**

People good at a vernaclular language, and those who have experience writing to a newspaper, please write to your local newspaper or TV news channel. Help this gain traction in people who might be heavily affected by it. Also, anyone giod at Hindi legalese please help out /u/Vidhrohi in his translation.

They say it's because those services run on top of infrastructure of the telcos but it kinda gives the impression like they're something extra. The name should also reflect that those services *are the entire reason why anybody bothers to pay for internet at all* nobody gets a 3G pack to just stare at 3 on their handset. They get it to *use the over the top services*.\n\nThe OTT's drive adoption of internet packs and useage of those packs.\n\nIn 2.60 they propose deep packet inspection, an invaisive technique that will necessarily have them monitor everything to check which sites you're going to. So say goodbye to privacy.\n\n2.50 clains growth in 4G will result in ten times more subscribers to Indian telcos in 5 yeras.\n\n....ugh just tired. I have a lot of notes on this, the best material is on\n\n2.12. Where they claim skype calls are loss of revenue but at 10paise/10 kb and the skype min data for a voice call at 30kbps, that's 60kbps to upload your voice and download the other's.\n\nThat's 450Kb per minute which means 4.5 rs/minute in data charges. This is the skype lost revenue they're whining about the greedy bastards.\n\nTalk about how you would react if these service charges are placed. It will not earn telcos any extra money, it wil just reduce the 83% percent of Indian users whose only access to the internet is through mobile. Since rural areas are soon to be connected, this will disproportionately affect the common man net user, who uses the internet only through his phone....\n\nI have more, will edit in later...\n\nplease email advqos@trai.gov.in to voice your opinion"", ""I posted this comment in another thread, but I found this and I thought it might be useful here too.\n\n------\n\nFirst off, for the ney-sayers.  I understand there are better political actions, but as an American citizen I have no influence or say in Indian politics.  The most I can do is help enable Indians to express themselves in some form.\n\nAs I said above, I am not super familiar with the issue in India nor am I an expert political writer. I am simply trying to do what I can with my skillset.  I will happily take any suggestions and improvements by those who are more familiar with the issue and communication norms in India. I would say the letter below is really just a way to let your government know that this is an important issue to you and you hope they can find a solution.\n\nI've also posted a copy of this here: https://www.sincerelyme.org/technology-and-science/regulate-indian-telecom-carriers-under-net-neutrality_i46\n\nYou can send it off with a couple of clicks or, preferably, customize it to express a personal message.\n\n-----\n\nDear {Recipient},\n\nI am writing to express my concern against the actions telecom carriers are taking to restrict fair access to the internet (i.e. Net Neutrality).  As a thriving and growing nation, the internet is a vital resource - it helps me communicate, work, and thrive as a citizen. If telecom operators are allowed to discriminate the flow of internet traffic solely on the basis of which services pay the most, we are allowing telecoms control over a vital and necessary technological resource.  We allow them to define what information we can view; what entertainment we can access; and what companies can innovate. This is completely unfair and harms India's long term role as major player in the global market.\n\nI understand the concern that regulation may deter telecoms from expanding access and speeds, but I strongly believe the growth of telecoms and the well-being of the internet can go hand-in-hand. I'm not asking for regulation so strong as to stifle progress, but only a framework to ensure long term and fair access for all services regardless of size.\n\nPlease understand that the internet is an important resource and vital to me. I would like to see it protected under Net Neutrality to ensure fair and equal access for myself and all.\n\nRegards,\n\n{Your Name}"", 'Excuse the slight rambling - From what I have seen here, most people don\'t know why net neutrality matters, other than snooping, or how it is implemented (by breaching privacy).\n\nI also don\'t think that people realize when the original NN argument came about (Which was a long while ago when Deep Packet Inspection was actually relatively new). The NN argument also has strong ties with the telecom network design of the States, and links all the way back to the split of Ma Bell, the original Bell telephone company. I really haven\'t seen many people discuss this first, and then move on to net neutrality.\n\nIn India, last mile connectivity is being achieved via mobile networks - for a lot of remote locations. The NN arguments must be modified to fit the indian context, especially by measuring the amount of benefit (if any) network providers are getting from the government to provide this service.\n\nAs it stands, I think vodafone and the others have paid market rate for spectrum, and so its harder to make the argument that they have been tasked with creating a social good (the telephone communication network). This needs to be attacked, so that Net Neutrality arguments transfer better.\n\nSome of the stronger arguments that do favor NN - \n\n1) AFAIK the core issue of NN is when a network starts paying attention to the content of the letters, and not in just delivering. And by reading the data in a packet, they are essentially breaking privacy \n\n2) the exact mechanism by which this will be implemented, may actually put the network providers at risk - by breaching privacy they end up being witness to all sorts of illegal acts. (Course the lawyers they pay will ensure that contracts will be designed to prevent this liability. But it should be used as an avenue of attack)\n\n3) More vexing is the issue where a service provider like wikipedia pays for their bandwidth costs anyway, and then have to pay extra, or get into an agreement which effectively skews the market place - to let the network behave as normal.\n\n4) One of the ways they could achieve ""fast lanes"" is by making everything else slow down. Again, the consumers pay more for the same thing. \n\n5) The fact that vodafone or who ever is losing money from their traditional system of revenue is also untrue - it can be argued that they wouldnt be selling so many phones, or so many connections if it were NOT for the various services the net enables.\n\n6) India is one of the *most* advanced mobile markets in the world. Theres FUCK loads of data on the mobile telephony sector. The telecom companies are profitable, and are still getting paid for their services. \n\n(PS: The last time someone had this discussion - people actually thought the network providers were laying direct lines to google servers, and were going to charge for the extra wires... Its hard for me to explain how wrong it was)\n\nEdit: it\'s been seven days since this post was made, I think the people who have been following this now know a lot more about net neutrality than before. I\'m expect that my first sentence is less accurate now.\n\nThis article covers deep packet inspection and net neutrality very well:  http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/07/deep-packet-inspection-meets-net-neutrality/1/', ""I will try to answer the questions, one-by-one.\n\n----\n\n**Question 1:** Is it too early to establish a regulatory framework for OTT services, since internet penetration is still evolving, access speeds are generally low and there is limited coverage of high-speed broadband in the country? Or, should some beginning be made now with a regulatory framework that could be adapted to changes in the future? Please comment with justifications.\n\n**Answer:** Yes it is and it always will be because there should be no regulation over OTT services.\n\n**Reason:** OTT services are just like any other Internet website like Facebook or Google. When you allow providers to regulate some of the Internet-based services you are opening a Pandora's box. It means providers can control any Internet-based activity and that will be the end of Internet freedom as we know it.\n\n----\n\n**Question 2:** Should the OTT players offering communication services (voice, messaging and video call services) through applications (resident either in the country or outside) be brought under the licensing regime? Please comment with justifications.\n\n**Answer and justification same as for question #1.**\n\n----\n\n**Question 3:** Is the growth of OTT impacting the traditional revenue stream of TSPs? If so, is the increase in data revenues of the TSPs sufficient to compensate for this impact? Please comment with reasons.\n\n**Answer:** No it is not.\n\n**Reason:** The TSPs revenues are only increasing because the more people use OTTs the more Internet usage time they will need to buy from the providers. When TSPs saw how popular OTT applications are they decided they need to find a way to monetise that. When a user pays to use WhatsApp or viber they are actually paying TSPs money for using the data that the user already paid for! This is so unjust that I cannot believe how they could even think of making such a demand.\n\n----\n\n**Question 4:** Should the OTT players pay for use of the TSPs network over and above data charges paid by consumers? If yes, what pricing options can be adopted? Could such options include prices based on bandwidth consumption? Can prices be used as a means product/service differentiation? Please comment with justifications.\n\n**Answer:** No they should not.\n\n**Reason:** Again I want to assert that this is no different from making, say, Google pay the TSP a fee for every time an Internet user performs a search. This is completely against the idea of net neutrality. There should not be any pricing options because there should not be any price at all.\n\n----\n\n**Question 5:** Do you agree that imbalances exist in the regulatory environment in the operation of OTT players? If so, what should be the framework to address these issues? How can the prevailing laws and regulations be applied to OTT players (who operate in the virtual world) and compliance enforced? What could be the impact on the economy? Please comment with justifications.\n\n**Answer:** OTT applications should not be regulated.\n\n**Reason:** Mentioned above.\n\n----\n\n**Question 6:** How should the security concerns be addressed with regard to OTT players providing communication services? What security conditions such as maintaining data records, logs etc. need to be mandated for such OTT players? And, how can compliance with these conditions be ensured if the applications of such OTT players reside outside the country? Please comment with justifications.\n\n**Answer:** The laws should not allow law enforcement authorities to access a user's personal conversations and other data unless there is a matter of national security."", 'I am making a draft reply, I hope to finish by today, will share. thank you all.', 'I  am currently in the process of reading the document and will try to post a summary soon, something that is concise and understandable, I would appreciate it if someone who is an expert in translating complex scientific and technological principles to Hindi would contact me, perhaps we can come up with a document in Hindi as well, the purpose of the Hindi doc would not be to replace the TRAI document as a whole, but act as a supplement for those whose prowess and grasp on the English language is tenuous.', ""Okay, I'm in and have started drafting a letter. \n\nThe TRAI has put up 20 questions.

5d2f334b0d7aab7428fc5e37	Top	Non-Political	988	TIL: How Soviet Union threatened US,UK and China to protect India	"Background:

Before 1971, Bangladesh used to be a part of Pakistan as East Pakistan. According to Najam Sethi, a well respected and honoured journalist from Pakistan, East Pakistan always complained that they received less development funds and less attention from the West Pakistan (Punjabi) dominating government. Bengalis in East Pakistan also resisted the adoption of Urdu as the state language. The revenue from export, whether it was from the Cotton of West Pakistan or Jute of East Pakistan, was handled mainly by West Pakistan. Lastly, in an election conducted just some months before the war, the victory was gained by the East Pakistani leader and still he was not given the power, thus fueling the movement in East Pakistan.

Pakistani army started its operation in East Pakistan to contain the movement and anger among the Bengalis. It is reported that the army was involved in mass killing of public and mass rape of women. India was aware of this and was only waiting for a trigger to start the war. India started receiving huge number of refugees which became unmanageable, pushing it to intervene in the situation. The situation soon attracted the attention of many other countries. Thus the war later was not only between India and Pakistan, but many countries were involved in 1971 Indo Pakistani war (War of Liberation of Bangladesh) directly or indirectly.

In May, Indira Gandhi wrote to Nixon about the ‘carnage in East Bengal’ and the flood of refugees, burdening India. After L K Jha (then the Indian ambassador to US) had warned Kissinger that India might have to send back some of the refugees as guerrillas, Nixon commented, ‘By God, we will cut off economic aid [to India].’

A few days later, when the US president said ‘the goddamn Indians’ were preparing for another war, Kissinger retorted ‘they are the most aggressive goddamn people around.

US and China Connection, A Little Known Fact
(All Excerpts and Sources from 929 page long Volume XI of the Foreign Relations of the United States)

US sympathized with Pakistan, because of various reasons. Among them two reasons were that: firstly, Pakistan belonged to American led military Pact, CENTO and SEATO; secondly, US believed any victory of India will be considered as the expansion of Soviet influence in the parts gained by India with the victory, as it was believed to be a pro Soviet nation, even though they were non aligned.

In a telegram sent (famously know as the Blood Telegram) to US Secretary of State Will Roger, on March 28, 1971, the staff of the US consulate in Dhaka complained, ‘Our government has failed to denounce the suppression of democracy. Our government has failed to denounce atrocities. Our government has failed to take forceful measures to protect its citizens while at the same time bending over backwards to placate the West Pakistan dominated government… We, as professional public servants express our dissent with current policy and fervently hope that our true and lasting interests here can be defined and our policies redirected in order to salvage our nation’s position as a moral leader of the free world.’

This brought China in the picture. US needed help from China and the messenger was Pakistan. US  approached China very secretly on this issue, who was more than welcoming as it believed that their relations with US could improve from this onward.

During the second week of July, 1971, Kissinger arrived in Beijing, where he heard the words by then Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai: “In our opinion, if India continues on its present course in disregard of world opinion, it will continue to go on recklessly. We, however, support the stand of Pakistan. This is known to the world. If they [the Indians] are bent on provoking such a situation, then we cannot sit idly by.’ On this, Kissinger responded that China should know that the US also backs Pakistan on this issue.

Indira Gandhi, the Indian prime minister in those times decided to tour most of the Western capitals to prove Indian stand and gain support and sympathy for the Bengalis of East Pakistan. On November 4th and 5th she met Nixon in Washington. Nixon straight forwardly told her that a new war in the subcontinent was out of the question.

The next day, Nixon and Kissinger assessed the situation. Kissinger told Nixon: ‘The Indians are bastards anyway. They are plotting a war.’

The pressure increased in East Pakistan, which attracted Indian attention. Indians were preparing for war and were concentrated on the Eastern front. To divert the pressure, on December 3, in the dark of night, even before India could attack East Pakistan, Pakistan opened western front and air raided six Indian Airfields in Kashmir and Punjab.

The CIA reported to the US President that Indian Prime Minister believes that the Chinese will never intervene militarily in North India, and thus, any action from China would be a surprise for India and Indian military might collapse in tensed situation caused by fighting in three different fronts (East, North and West).

Hearing this, on December 9, Nixon decided to send the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise into the Bay of Bengal to threaten India. The plan was to Surround India from all four sides and force them to retreat and leave East Pakistan.

On December 10, Nixon instructed Kissinger to ask the Chinese to move some troops toward the Indian frontier. ‘Threaten to move forces or move them, Henry, that’s what they must do now.’ China feared any action on India might attract Soviet aggression. At this, US assured China that any action taken by Soviet Union will be countered by US to protect China.

Britain and Soviet Confrontation
Confidential – The Commander of the Military Intelligence Service Gen. Pyotr Ivashutin.

“The Soviet Intelligence has reported that the English operative connection has come nearer to territorial India, water led by an aircraft carrier “Eagle” [On December 10]. For helping friendly India, Soviet government has directed a group of ships under the command of admiral V. Kruglyakov.”

Vladimir Kruglyakov, the former (1970-1975) Commander of the 10th Operative Battle Group (Pacific Fleet) remembers:

“I was ordered by the Chief Commander to track the British Navy’s advancement, I positioned our battleships in the Bay of Bengal and watched for the British carrier “Eagle”.

But Soviet Union didn’t have enough force to resist if they encountered the British Carrier. Therefore, to support the existing Soviet fleet in the Bay of Bengal, Soviet cruisers, destroyers and nuclear submarines, equipped with anti ship missiles, were sent from Vladivostok.

In reaction English Navy retreated and went South to Madagascar.

Soon the news of American carrier Enterprise and USS Tripoli’s advancement towards Indian water came.

V. Kruglyakov “ I had obtained the order from the commander-in-chief not to allow the advancement of the American fleet to the military bases of India”

In an interview to a Russian TV programme after his retirement, Admiral Kruglyakov, who commanded the Pacific Fleet from 1970 to 1975, recalled that Moscow ordered the Russian ships to prevent the Americans and British from getting closer to “Indian military objects”. The genial Kruglyakov added: “The Chief Commander’s order was that our submarines should surface when the Americans appear. It was done to demonstrate to them that we had nuclear submarines in the Indian Ocean. So when our subs surfaced, they recognised us. In the way of the American Navy stood the Soviet cruisers, destroyers and atomic submarines equipped with anti-ship missiles. We encircled them and trained our missiles at the Enterprise. We blocked them and did not allow them to close in on Karachi, Chittagong or Dhaka.""

The Soviet ships had small range rockets (only upto 300 KM). Therefore, to hold the opponent under the range, commanders ran risks of going as near to the enemy as possible.

“The Chief Commander had ordered me to lift the submarines and bring them to the surface so that it can be pictured by the American spy satellites or can be seen by the American Navy!’ It was done to demonstrate, that we had all the needed things in Indian Ocean, including the nuclear submarines. I had lifted them, and they recognized it. Then, we intercepted the American communication. The commander of the Carrier Battle Group was then the counter-admiral Dimon Gordon. He sent the report to the 7th American Fleet Commander: ‘Sir, we are too late. There are Russian nuclear submarines here, and a big collection of battleships’.

Americans returned and couldn’t do anything. Soviet Union had also threatened China that, if they ever opened a front against India on its border, they will receive a tough response from North.

The war ended with the surrender of Pakistani army as they missed American help due to quick Russians who blocked both America and China from preventing India to advance. With this, a new country named Bangladesh was formed, which was recognized by the whole world and by Pakistan in the following year with Shimla Agreement.

5d2f334f0d7aab7428fc5e39	Top	Non-Political	986	Oxford student harassed by Indians on Quora for being able to solve the JEE Advance question paper	"*Edit: I would like to clarify that I'm not Jack Fraser, considering that many people were getting confused. I rather posted his Quora answer here, the link to which is at the bottom of the post.*

This was a particularly unpleasant thing that happened to me a few weeks back.

Someone asked a question in the topic [Jack Fraser (Quora user)](https://www.quora.com/topic/Jack-Fraser-Quora-user), which went something along the lines of

“Can Jack Fraser solve the JEE paper?”

(For those of you who don’t know, the JEE is an Indian physical sciences admissions paper for their universities - some people take it **_really_** seriously, a fact I didn’t know at the time!)

I thought it would be a laugh to sit down and do the paper, and see how I did.

There were two papers, about 80 multiple choice questions each.

Now.

This is where I made my mistake.

**I told them how I breezed through it. **I did it in about a third of the allowed time, and with 100% correct answers.

* * *

**BIG mistake.**

* * *

Now, first of all I think I need to make some qualifications:

- I am a third year physics student
- This is a high school-level paper, taken by ~17 year olds _who haven’t spent 3 years at university studying physics_
- I have been sitting physics exams every year for nigh-on 7 years now
- Multiple choice makes exams **immeasurably** easier

As I explained in [this answer here](https://www.quora.com/Jack-Fraser-dominates-all-basic-physics-I-mean-can-he-easily-respond-to-any-problem-in-basic-physics-books/answer/Jack-Fraser-11), it thus comes as no surprise that I found a test designed for people much less educated in physics than me pretty easy.

It’s nothing special - nobody is surprised when a 6 year old can walk, and a baby _can’t_.

It would be significantly _more_ worrying if £27,000 being spent on 3 years at one of the best universities on this planet didn’t prepare me to ace an _admissions test for another university!_

* * *

Now - I explained all of this in my answer, in painstaking detail.

…

…

It didn’t go down well.

I was called a liar. Insults were thrown.

One guy called me scum.

I was told there was simply no way a simpleton like me could do well on this — it is simply the hardest exam to ever grace the face of this planet.

* * *

This stuff was pretty mild — and Quora took care of the abuse well enough that I had no complaints.

But then some people took the issue _off_ Quora. They found my Facebook.

They found my **_family’s Facebook_**_._

My mother got some **_graphic _**pictures of male genitalia. My brother got sent threats. My Facebook profile picture was reported for ‘graphic indecency’ a few times, and I had a flood of abusive message appearing in my “Message Request” box. One guy sent me a picture of my (old) university accommodation, saying they knew where I lived*, and that he was going to “shiv” me.

It was really rather traumatic.

I deleted the answer, and a few days later the entire question was deleted by Moderation.

I don’t know if it was one guy using dozens of accounts (they were all fake profiles), or a cabal of several people,but eventually it petered out.

Facebook (slowly) dealt with it, and the stuff went away.

My Mum still refers to it as “The time that guy had such low self esteem that he considered me seeing his penis to be the worst insult imaginable”.

So it’s not so much that the response was _on_ Quora — indeed, the problem was that it escalated beyond the bounds of Quora.

I’m not going to answer any more questions about the JEE. It seems like it’s a bit too touchy a subject!

* * *

* This would have been more threatening if it wasn’t the top result when you google [trinity college oxford](https://www.google.co.uk/search?bih=590&biw=1280&q=trinity+college+oxford&rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB703GB703&sa=X&source=lnms&tbm=isch&ved=0ahUKEwjgvLzf_LjSAhWqD8AKHXK0BFAQ_AUICCgB). And if I still lived there, which I don’t.

* * *

PS. To the hundreds of people flooding to the comments section and my inbox to apologise for these people and assert that it's not all Indians - no need.

I am in fact madly in love with one of your countrywomen, and am perfectly aware that this is a small, idiotic minority. There is no need to fret that I am tarring all Indians with the same brush!

Poor industrial growth and rising unemployment don't help them either. Saving is the most secure option for them."", ""India's middle class are without safety net i.e they're marriage/accident/one bad disease away from slipping into poverty.\n\nAnd there are as many opinions about numbers of India's middle class as there are Modi's Bhakts/Congressi. \n\nSo take this piece with salts. Why? Because the newly formed middle class in India still believe in savings more than expenditures(reason slipping into poverty, marriage, poojas etc). So the comparison with Western Middle Class will always lead to dead end as they will never show the same characteristics like them i.e consumerism in the form of buying cars, bikes and other things(which is ~~gradually~~ changing at snail pace).\n\nSo they form assumptions which leads to very low or very high numbers thus leading to insane numbers i.e economist's (lower figures quoted from many Economist) or that 600 million figure. \n\nSecondly the exemption of Farmers/Farming Income and ease of dodging taxes by Traders/kiosks/Retailers/businesses which leads to very low taxes. Even when you add Indirect Taxes, its very easy to dodge VAT there(Source: shopkeeper got away with paying bribe at ₹1000 per year to inspectors, sales over ₹5,000,000/year for nearly 100 retail shopkeeper (town)) so tax model also becomes a bad model to project the numbers.\n\nThirdly the inherently flawed PPP model, The expenses are very different for different places in India hell there is difference in Cost of Living in Delhi and Mumbai. India is a very diverse place which leads to average or any particular average Income not working. Take Bihar and Kerala, where would it be cheaper to live in village? A Wedding Suit costs around ₹12000 in village in Bihar while the same xan be bought for ₹2000-3000 in Delhi while you will pay ₹10000 rent in Delhi(least for 2BHK) and ₹1-2000 in Bihar(village) So you would need to find the Income(PPP) for every State which leads to too much work. Thus its like calculating the numbers by taking South African Economy as base for whole African Continent.\n\nSo what should the companies target? They've to do their own homework and research before launching anything. There severe draught of data when it comes to India, so rigorous collection of data and analysis by the company is needed.\n\nTLDR: My point being Indian Middle Class are nothing like Western or even Chinese Middle Class.

It is a widely held belief that in the time of the second Sikh Guru Angad Sahib Ji (1538-1552 A.D.), LaNDa was the writing system employed in Punjab. Observing the inadequacy of LaNDa in its tendency to omit vowel signs, Guru Angad Sahib Ji decided to modify the script. The alphabet 'rarra' was added by Guru Nanak Sahib ji. Muslim Sufi saints also influenced the literature a lot with Baba Farid among the prominent ones, but Guru Granth Sahib Ji remains the only written source of his teachings. ਸ਼ is used for sanskrit derived loan words, while ਖ਼, ਗ਼, ਜ਼, ਫ਼,  for farsi loan words.

According to a report by ANI, Mahendra Nath Pandey after garlanding the statue of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay at Deendyal Dham told media that he is not supposed to pay the toll fee since he is an MP. When the media asked him that he is the State BJP President but why did he not pay any toll tax while crossing the toll tax plaza when his convoy was coming from Firozabad, Pandey replied, “Any other question?” He further went on to say, “I am the member of the parliament and I am toll-free, any other question?”\n\nNews agency ANI also posted a video of the incident on its official Twitter handle in which Pandey can be heard making this statement. “Main saansad (MP) hu aur main toll free hu (I am an MP and I am toll free),” he was quoted saying by ANI. However, FinancialExpress.com cannot verify the authenticity of the video. When the reporters retaliated by saying that he is a Parliamentarian but the people who were travelling in his convoy are not Members of the Parliament, Pandey angrily replied, “I am present at the Deendayal Dham; is there any other question, then ask?”\n\nWatch the incident here:\n\n#WATCH: When asked why he did not pay toll tax, UP BJP Chief Mahendra Nath Pandey says, “Main saansad (MP) hu aur main toll free hu.” pic.twitter.com/mmihFDY3Tr — ANI UP (@ANINewsUP) September 17, 2017\n\nThe drama didn’t end here, as per the ANI report. When the media tried to ask the question again, Pandey said, “If you have any other question, then ask.” Pandey is currently a BJP MP from Chandauli Lok Sabha constituency. He has replaced Keshav Prasad Maurya as UP BJP chief who guided the party to victory in the state assembly elections.\n\nEarlier in August, Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was caught in the camera passing the toll plaza without paying the toll tax with a convoy of 175 cars in Barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.']"	2017-09-17 18:49:12	None

Also we have been told that they wear half chaddi because they are exercising non-stop in the shakhas and RSS brings discipline in their life.    

As Lalu Prasad Yadavji said ""Amit Shah, Narendra Modi, Nitin Gadkari, Devendra Fadnavis, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Venkaiah Naidu, Harsh Vardhan, Giriraj Singh and several others are all obese. They wouldn't have put on so much girth had they been such ardent followers of yoga as they are projecting themselves to be,...Why all this hypocrisy for a day?""   

Please discuss.  "	https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3mam3r/does_yog_really_keep_you_fit/	25	"['Your troll of a post aside, Yog consists of several all body exercises, so it helps if you are actually doing it.\n\n[From a recent article on Time](http://time.com/4037157/yoga-arthritis-joint-pain/)\n\n> But a recent [randomized controlled trial](http://www.jrheum.org/content/42/7/1194.abstract) published in the Journal of Rheumatology finds that people with arthritis who practice yoga can reap impressive physical and mental benefits. Those who practiced yoga three times a week had an improvement in pain levels, energy, mood and physical health compared to the group that didn’t do yoga—and the effects lasted even nine months later.\n\nI find the [paper](http://www.jrheum.org/content/42/7/1194.abstract) a bit dishonest in the sense that any all body exercise done regularly would keep you fit, not just Yog.', 'Yog is useless. \n\nOne should eat chara (fodder) just like the messiah of Bihar, Lalu Yadav. \n\nThe second best way is to go to a gym regularly. Preferably 6-8 hours daily and in a 5 star property. Just like Mr. Vadra. \n\n', 'This is way too obvious, walrus ji. As an admirer of your work, it pains me to see your standards slipping. Y u do dis? :(', 'Yes Yoga does help to keep you fit but Yoga is not the only thing that can keep you fit...I believe any other normal exercise can keep you fit.

They wouldn\'t have put on so much girth had they been such ardent followers of yoga\n\nThat statement is idiotic & only the likes of Lalu can make it.  \n\nThey might be praising yoga & it\'s benefits but that does not mean that they are practicing it regularly. Yoga is good exercise for sure & thus they being obese does not mean they should not preach it.  \n\nNaMo might be the perfect example of benefits of Yoga, the amount of energy he has at his age is remarkable.', ""Energy out > energy in. You can run a fucking marathon, you wont lose weight if you consume more calories than the run can burn.\n\nAs for if Yoga can keep you fit. Yes. I've found it to be especially helpful if you have a good fitness base. As a personal anecdote, I was very fit in my late teens early 20s due to sports and gym. Mid 20s was my lazy phase with little exercise and generally trying out a lot of different food. I didn't get really fat, but I wasn't fit. Burnt a lot of that last year doing Yoga.\n\nYoga is the sort of inbetween cardio and weight training. It builds muscle strength more than cardio does but not as much as weight training, so you wont get the muscle definition if that's what you're going for. Cardio burns more calories though, but if you hate cardio like me, Yoga is for you.\n\nAlso, good diet. Like I said, Energy out > energy in.\n\nAnd yes, I'm aware of the intention behind this thread."", ""If and only if you do it right. Won't get you a Bollywood six pac but will keep you in shape and healthy."", 'http://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3m8ft2/z/cvcw6uv', 'yes, yoga is very beneficial. ', 'main benefit of yoga is that it is structured exercise with progressive difficulties you can do at any age without equipments.\n\nIf you are young and healthy a good gym is your best bet.', ""That is because all these BJP leaders are lazy hypocrites.. They preach Indian culture, and Hindu living, but they themselves are either too lazy to follow it or don't actually believe in those practices.. Not only Yoga, you can find this hypocrisy everywhere. Like they praise Hindi/Sanskrit but will send their kids to English medium school and degree abroad.. They praise Ayurveda, but whenever get a disease, they run to the Biggest hospital or go abroad for treatment..

It typifies my mood: I truly feel a growing sense of impotent rage. Intolerance has always existed in this country, only never before has extremism been legitimised so brazenly by powerful sections of society. A man is lynched in Dadri and very few truly empathise with the grief of a poor family. Instead, rabble rousers continue to pursue their agenda to decide on what people should eat: the obvious aim is to stir a Hindu Muslim divide. Ink is thrown at a public figure, a music concert of one the greatest ghazal singers is stalled: the debate isn't about free artistic expression but becomes about who is 'patriotic' and who is not. Sahitya Akademi award winners return their awards and their right to dissent is not accepted; instead, they are abused and targeted as 'pseudo-intellectuals'. The new buzzword is 'selective outrage': if you didn't outrage about a crime against a Hindu you have no moral right to outrage when a Muslim is killed. Killings it seems have become a zero sum game: your riot versus mine. We don't spare anyone who might wish to break from the official narrative that seeks to promote majoritarianism in the garb of silencing all those who might insist on a greater reach out to the more vulnerable minority groups. When Naseeruddin Shah, arguably the finest stage actor of our generation, says he is being made conscious of his Muslim identity for the first time, being dubbed 'anti national' for attending a seminar, you wonder what kind of a civil society are we bequeathing to the next generation. Even our respected prime minister from whom we seek leadership and guidance will tweet to wish Navjot Sidhu a quick recovery from hospital but will not say a word on Akhlaq's family's loss. This is an India which is crying out for a Mahatma who puts compassion and tolerance above all else. We are left instead with men with self proclaimed broad chests but very small hearts. As I said: yeh Kahan aa Gaye hum.	https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ovh1k/rajdeep_sardesai_just_posted_this_on_facebook_p/	31	"['Now even song reminds him of all the wrong things running in India.

* 1 Indian people quietly loathe, but accept the fairness mania.. everyone literally thinks it's OK to look at fairness as an attractive quality when choosing a husband/wife/boyfriend/girlfriend. 

You know we can't change our genotypes right? We will always be brown, or dark brown.

* 2 Indians put the language of the oppressive british regime, English, as one of the ""national"" languages. The ""good schools"" are christian schools with emphasis on english. 

Sure, the tamils don't speak hindi... then why not LEARN hindi instead of english. (hindi is closer to tamil as a language than english).

ENGLISH IS A NECESSARY LANGUAGE TO BE FLUENT IN, but it isn't required to be your primary language. (look at germany, japan, france, sweden..etc).

* 3 Many Indian Moslims think they're not even ""Indian"" ethnically. They believe they apparently are descended from ""arabs/persians"". (maybe 5% of them are... but this thinking is frighteningly more wide-spread than 5%)

* 4 Some Indian Christians tend to try to be more ""english"" or ""american"" RATHER THAN ""christian"". (I said some, not all) 

* 5 Many Hindus hate their scriptures, religion. Yes, many scriptures are clearly frightening (some puranas). But have you read a book as open-minded and philosophically rich as the Gita? or the ISA upanishad?

What you said is only true of single issue voters when that issue is islam. A more realistic point of view would be to group people in n-D space treating them as political vectors. [In simple terms, single issue segregation is classification(separation line) on a single axis, and so on.] Each issue has different 'weight' to different voter.

So, I abruptly stop my thought train, sorry. "", ""Essentially, our brain is compartmentalised and it segregates things. It's like many people who eat meat also have pets.

The plan includes some anonymous twitter accounts who are regularly involved in calling out startups and then move onto twitter influencers.

The modus operandi is this

A week before the blog, a lot of influencers would talk of Women's day and harassment at work place. Slowly these anon twitter accounts would swoop in and publish this blog. This blog was intentionally badly written to make it appear dubious. And once enough traction has been achieved, some more twitter influencers would tweet claiming a lot of people has messaged them telling their experiences with this guy. Then the rebuttal from TVF was carefully worded to provoke people and appear insensitive. At this point, the FB post was planned to be posted. She would then play it for a week and then reveal to the entire world what a horrible thing work place harassment is for the women. This would coincide with the first stream of their web series.

Police said so far 98 have succumbed and around 40 more are under treatment in various government and private hospitals since the past four days.

The tragedy occurred after scores of slum residents in Malwani, a northern suburb, bought and consumed methanol-infused hooch from local bootleggers. The concentration of toxic methanol in the hooch was high enough to send more than a hundred consumers to the hospital with complaints of breathlessness, stomach aches and failing vision. The death toll is now higher than that of Mumbai’s last major hooch catastrophe in 2004, when 89 people had died in Vikhroli.

**Fact 5:** Article 239 AA (http://delhiassembly.nic.in/constitution.htm) of the Constitution will enlighten you that the JLP cannot be tabled directly, without writing to the President. This was outlined by the Additional Solicitor General.

Want all bollywood movies to be full of neorealistic / parallel cinema, but absolutely adore sci-fi from hollywood eg - ""Deadpool is so great. #niceCock""



2. Want some movies to be realistic, don't care about others. Example - want to see all reality in fun bollywood movies, but like movies like ""Udta Punjab"" because yeah fucking Tommy Singh is totally real.



3. See acting by actors in low budget cinema, but not in mainstream cinema. Example - Everyone is talking about FAN is this, fan is that. Some hate it, but the people who hate it have not praised SRK's acting or even talked about it. ""The film sucks because I want the story of a homosexual villager but I am getting a much more entertaining movie instead #IamTheBestCritic"".



4. Rating acting on physical work by the actor. 

Example - There are thousands of ""intelligent"" janta on fb and even here who are like ""OMG Hooda has lost 18kg weight in 28 days. GIVE HIM THE NATIONAL AWARD #IloveJaatCock"". Fuck you! Award because he lost weight to look malnutrished? The work done by people like Salma, Hrithik, SRK and other stars on their bodies to look good is nothing?



5. Pre made opinions on the movie by the name of actors.

Example - Anurag Kashyap, Nawazuddin, Paresh Rawal, etc.

Where'd you learn logic? The Rohit Shetty institute of Physics?"", ""1. I expect a movie to be as it is advertised. Eg. Nobody watching *Deadpool* trailer/promotion should have any doubt about the kind of movie it is, and it delivered on them. By being funny, uncharacteristically honest, and extremely true to its origin(comics). OTOH, many Bollywood movies are advertised with realistic story/characters/action and deliver none. Eg. Ra.one, krrish. \n\n2. Similar to 1. Deadpool is expected to be unrealistic been cause that's what it's genre is and how it's advertised. *Fault in our Stars* is not expected to be unrealistic because it's genre/promotion is different. Theovoe doesn't lie about its nature before release. A great example I like is with *Wanted*,*Dabang*,*Dabang 2*. First 2 were advertised comedy action and delivered. Last was advertised with great realistic action, excellent story and turned out it had neither.\n\n3. For all the worth they have proven, unfortunately, three biggest names in industry (a.k.a. Khans) have disappointed almost universally and consistently for past few years. At the same time, small budgeted movies have proven to be excellent while expected nothing of, like *Lunchbox*. People tend to shift their attention/devotion to things that turned up profit(quality) on investment(tickets).\n\n4. No one is rejecting hardword by actors to get buffed up. But you must realise, it takes equally brutal work/devotion to reduce weight. Reducing weight by that much in that less time means living on an apple a day. Try it someday and you'll realise how hard that is, then imagine living off if that while doing everything else like nothing changed.\n\n5. Of course, people form opinions if there is no variation in one's work over years. You hear *Rohit Shetty* and of course you think flying cars, stretched out comedy, and action scenes with high frequency sounds, heavulky drumed up songs with large crowds. People think Nawazuddin/Irrfan/Paresh Rawal to have performed well because they have consistently outperformed expectations. No one doubts Amitabh because he has proven even a shitty movie shall have excellent acting by him. Khans, unfortunately have proven to do exactly opposite. Eg. Dhoom 3, Dabang 2, Dilwale.\n\nAs for Last,our opinion, You are entitled to have your, everyone else, to have theirs. Chill, if want to watch *Fan*, go ahead. If you like it, good for you.

5d2f373f0d7aab7428fc6399	Controversial	Non-Political	16	DAE Think that there is a huge conspiracy underfoot to discredit India.	"So I am not the kind of person who believes in conspiracy theories, but the turn of events over this year has me broadly convinced that the Indian MSM is working against our interests and there is a larger cabal with sufficient economic resources and a clear agenda driving it. 

I think it all started with the Modi govt. banning NGOs. So, I was one of those who thought that this was a retrograde move. A lot of NGO's do good - I know for a fact that a lot of implicit missionary activities goes on behind the scenes, but I have no problem if people convert to christianity so that they can make bread. The christian missionaries might have ulterior motives - but its still fine with me. The poor of this country are better of with bread and god, than neither. 

I think all this media manipulation started of post this act of hte Modi govt.. When NGO's were pumping money into India, there was a relatively easy channel to 'wake up' our population to the service of Jesus. But the ban on NGO's put water to by and large this act which had been going unhindered for a couple of decades now. The media manipulation that we are seeing now, is partly a response to this act of the Modi govt. and partly a newer and more effective strategy to bring Jesus into our lives. It is this more effective strategy which has rankled me most.

Even though Indians might see themselves a secular country, the world - and by and large the western world, does not. For the west India is broadly Hindu - the failings of India are by and large the failings of Hinduism. The media strategy is amazingly effective because it does not need to direct Hindusim - what it does instead is direct India itself and it is left to the imagination of the audience to make that connect with Hindusim. This, as most marketing gurus will tell you, is one of the most effective marketing ploys. Do not sell water to the thirsty, but glorify the beauty of your wells and let people make that connect in their minds. 

I think it is broadly known that a lot of agencies which funds NGO's in India also have significant interests in the media. Add to that delipidated law and order infrastructure in the country and lot of medieval social/cultural mores still present in parts of the society makes India the perfect hot spot for these kind of shenanigans. A population which is acutely aware of their failings is the perfect ground for the harvesting of souls - the societies which come from Jesus do not have any such social ills and this connect is left for the audience to make for themselves.

The biggest success of this strategy was obviously the delhi rape incident and the documentary behind it. However, I would like to give credit to the home minister Rajnath singh, who acted like a rank amateur here and walked into the trap by banning it. The documentary was shoddily made and it would have died a natural death had it not been for the home minister who is probably the weakest link in the modi govt. However, credit should also be given to NDTV who went on a rampage and raped India in broad daylight. Barkha dutt defending India was either born out of her realisation that her game is being outed and so that she can salvage whatever little credibility is left.

The thing is that this game is not over yet and everyday I am reading news reports which try to play up this angle. There was something on bachelors not getting rents or maybe it was muslims. Then there was the thing about a muslim guy being denied jobs. The thing is that in a country as diverse as India, these things will always happen in a certain number. Even then India is significantly less discriminatory then for example say America which has incredible amount of rascism between blacks, whites and browns."	https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3a9bdt/dae_think_that_there_is_a_huge_conspiracy/	50	"[""There's no conspiracy.\n\nHowever, criticizing India, Indian government, culture, and general goings on, especially from a western perspective, using words and phrasings that resonate with the western reader (and by transmission with the aspirational Indian class) is hugely profitable for a lot of individuals and media companies.\n\nIt's just another way that the world is fucked up. That's all."", ""You don't need a conspiracy to explain it.\n\n1. A BJP government is obviously rightwing, and large sections of media is leftwing and liberal. A clash is expected.\n\n2. That India is rape capital of the world is a belief that predates the new government. That in fact was believed always, and was further established by the Delhi gangrape. Anti rape activism inevitably involves criticising the society that gives rise to it, the law and order situation and gender inequality - and Modi happened to be the PM. He can resign tomorrow and bring MMS back, and that campaign will continue.\n\n3. Banning NGOs, as you said, will lead to a lot of the media and in India turning against the BJP government. I am sure this is factored into the calculations by the PM and Amit Shah. Some NGOs are into conversion, the vast majority are not but split between doing actual good (as you said) and little ways to con money out of goodhearted people. But giving them trouble, rightly or wrongly, will give a lot of journalists a good reason to turn critical. You could say international media is driven by Christians, but pretty much no journalist is a believer in any religion. They are mostly all atheists or agnostic.\n\n4. NDTV will always be anti BJP. That is where their audience is. CNN IBN is now pro BJP and pro AmMbani. Easy to see. Headlines Today is where refugees from CNN IBN have gone, so they will be anti BJP. TimesNow will always be pro-Arnab and pro-Nation. Rest are as they were. Newspapers are as they were.\n\nUnder a BJP government, treatment of minorities, free speech, freedom of religion, all will be watched and critiqued carefully.\n\n**You may be surprised, but I doubt Modi or Amit Shah are.

Then watch as people blame everything from chow mein to western pressures when they find themselves in a world where they dont have a path laid out for them.\n\nIn short.

5d2f37530d7aab7428fc63a2	Controversial	Politics	0	The most successful Kings of India were all non Vedic.And the most foolish were Vedic. A Historical recap for Trivedi Goel.	"1) Let us analyse the greatest of Kings of India and abroad and the most foolish of them from pre - medieval and Medeival History.

One thing will be clear globally

1) The Most successful ones were (So to speak Pagans), but they were not Banias (Followers of Vedas, Puranas  or from any Gotra)but independent men who believed in meritocracy.

2)The most foolish ones, the least successful ones were all Vedic.

The backdrop of this analysis is the most basic classification of people. Devas and Asuras. Anyone who followed the Vedic system and adhered to the principles of the Banias and Brahmins were connoted as Devas and the ones who did not were connoted as Asuras as per the more populous Gotras(Then and till today, the combined gotra populations make the Gotra groups of India one of the most widely entrenched, populous and vast social networks of non productive vegetables the planet has ever seen).We can consider the world as a one whole instead of nation states, in that era. We do not analyse prehistory,in a time when Vishnu and Ram and other Vedic Gods did not exist but medieval History. We will pit Human Asuras (So to speak) against Vedic Gods(So to speak) and compare their achievements. 

1) Ram

Genus :  Bania (Indo Aryan)

Achievements: Did nothing, built no monument, unverified birth location, convinced one group of natives(Marathi monkeys as per Ramayan) to attack a smaller group of natives( South Indians) to avenge the shame of his wife running away with the Richer, Technologically Advanced, Aerial Car Driving Southern King after his wife crossed the Lakshman Rekha. Finally committed suicide after dumping his unchaste wife.(Aum).

2)Parashuram

Genus: Indo Aryan (Bania)
Achievements :  Did nothing,built no monuments, settled some Banias into the southern Lands of Kerala. Murdered his mother who was tempted by Rich native men, unverified existence.

3) Vamana:

Genus :  Dwarf Brahmin ( Indo Aryan), came to Kerala with a group of Brahmins, asked King Mahabali for land and then back-stabbed him by exploding Bania population.

4) Krishna

Genus :  3rd class Indo Aryan(Mixed Blood between Native and Indo Aryan)

Achievements: Did nothing, instigated war and propounded already well established Cosmic Philosophy from the Sramana system and packaged it well.Built nothing.Died by a hunters arrow.

5) Other small Vedic Fish : Bimbisara, Ajatashatru ..did nothing.

Non Vedic Heroes(Asuras):

1) Ashoka( Native, Bihari) -  Conquered all of Northern India until he converted to Buddhism.

2) Kanishka,(A Kushan King, Non Vedic) - Conquered all of Northern India till the Tarim Basin in Central Asia.

3)Alexander -  Conquered 1/2 the known world.Built Alexandria

4) Genghis Khan - Conquered the World

5)Cyrus the Great -  Conquered the Known World, built Persepolis

6) Ashurbanipal -  Conquered the known world, Built the Largest ancient Library.

7) Nebuchadenezzar -  Conquered the known world, sacked Jerusalem.

8) Sargon of Akkad -  Root for the word, Sarrukin (Now Sharukh Khan), built Sumeria and conquered the known world.

9) Raja Raja Chola -  Conquered from South of India till the Ganges, built Gangai Konda Cholapuram and Brihadeeshwara Temple.

Akbar, Timur and others...not to mention.

We can consistently see why India is poor, because the Vedic people(Devas) and their kings are non inspirational and have noo aspiration and light in them. All they want to do is say Aum and drink milk,play holy with the cows ets and ban eggs in anganwadis. Basically, Goels lives the life of an insect and then come back to live the life of an insect.And India stays, malnourished, backward and poor.For there is noo light in the Vedas.

5d2f375d0d7aab7428fc63a8	Controversial	Politics	4	CMV: Triple Talaq is a Progressive Law	"Triple talaq has been dismissed as medieval and barbaric piece of shitty sexist law and people  supporting it are called creeps.

Wait a minute.....

And what exactly is the other option? Not allowing divorce at all? Feminists talk about consent. Like consent can be granted and then taken back. But when it comes to marriage, once you get married you cannot get out of marriage without the other person allowing to it. 

Considering India where there are loads of arranged marriages and many forced or persons don't exactly know their partners properly, not allowing divorce without partners consent is not exactly progressive. It's just like forced marriages. I haven't seen anyone speak against this oppression of forcing people to stay in marriages. All this talk of banning unilateral divorce for men instead of talking about allowing unilateral divorce for women shows this issue is not about barbaric laws. It's about muslims. 

Triple talaq is just instantaneous unilateral divorce. It's not medieval or barbaric. It's pretty progressive. The only objection which women's rights activists can say against it is that it's available only for men. But when instead of that, when they talk about banning unilateral divorce for men also, I cannot take them seriously. 

Its not just men, Muslim women also have options to end marriage unilaterally. There are already two provisions in the Muslim Personal Law. 

1) Talaq e Tafweez - Delegated divorce. The wife demands right of divorce when getting married. If this right is included in the marriage contract, then she can issue divorce just like triple talaq. Only thing is that it's not included by default. 

2) Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage(Khula) - When the wife cannot tolerate her husband or doesn't like him she can file for divorce. This doesn't require the consent of her husband. Also it's available only under Muslim Personal Law. 

In all other personal laws one cannot get out of marriage without mutual consent. You are forced to stay in marriage against your will. I don't see why nobody is speaking up against such forced marriages?

In fact BJP government dropped the Irretrievable breakdown of marriage for grounds for divorce.

http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bill-to-make-divorce-easier-may-be-dropped/article6910089.ece


>Groups opposing the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill contend that it will cause an increase in ""illegitimate and live-in relations and thereby a fall of the institution of marriage and family values.""

Since then the Supreme Court has on a number of occasions recommended the inclusion of irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a ground for divorce.

BJP does kulcha nonsense and opposes amendment of Hindu law while acting as women's rights activist in case of Muslim personal law.

Hindu Law does not have Triple Talaq, so are you saying that no Hindu women are being divorced? Ironically, one of the defenses of Owaisi and his ilk is that there are many Hindu women being divorced. In fact, he claims 68.8% women being divorced in India are Hindu. [Source](https://twitter.com/asadowaisi/status/789878840671674368)\n\n>Triple talaq is just instantaneous unilateral divorce. It\'s not medieval or barbaric. It\'s pretty progressive.\n\nKey words being *unilateral* and *instantaneous*. You cannot call a law serious when it allows separation from SMS, fax machines etc.\n\n>There are already two provisions in the Muslim Personal Law.\n\nCan you provide me statistics of how many marriages are registered with such clauses? Do Mullahs and Qazis inform the women about these rights before the marriage? Are the required by law to do so? (Like Miranda rights or some such). How can we ensure that Muslim women are aware of these rights before marrying? On the other hand if the law was uniform and was not controlled by mullahs, then it would automatically apply to all women without them having to know about these laws (as they are derived from scripture) before hand. \n\n> In all other personal laws one cannot get out of marriage without mutual consent. You are forced to stay in marriage against your will. I don\'t see why nobody is speaking up against such forced marriages?\n\nNo. Hindu women can apply for divorce on the grounds of infidelity, STD, religious differences and cruelty among others. The couples can also chose to separate and after a period of separation they can file for divorce. [Source](https://sites.google.com/site/indiandivorcelaws/grounds-of-divorce-under-hindu-marriage-act-1955). They are not forced by law to stay married. However, what prevents a lot of unhappy couple from separating is societal pressure. They are looked down upon by their family and peers and so may choose to stay together rather than separate.\n\nWhat one cannot do is cite ""Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage"" and as grounds for filing divorce and get divorced quickly. Fair enough, that is a valid criticism. But then by your own admission this right is also not available to Muslim women by default. Only a woman who is well versed in Islamic theology and the convoluted laws setup by AIMPLB would know this.\n\nThis brings us to your final point.\n\n>BJP does kulcha nonsense and opposes amendment of Hindu law while acting as women\'s rights activist in case of Muslim personal law.\n\nLet us limit our discussion here to only Triple Talaq as your post and my comment has. Let us recall the timeline of incidents:\n\n1. Shayara Bano gets divorced in October 2015. Contrary to your rant, she has been abused in her marriage and yet finds she is unable to walk out of it. *She has not asked for UCC or codification of Muslim Personal Law*.\n2. The Supreme Court while hearing other cases asks the Chief Justice to set up a Bench to examine gender discrimination against Muslim women, especially “arbitrary divorce”.\n3. The case snowballs and many other cases add up, which is really strange considering your claim that Muslim Personal Law is the *only* progressive Law in the country.\n4. BMMA, an organisation for Muslim Women Rights, also gets in the fray. It has conducted a [study](https://bmmaindia.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/triple-talaq-report.pdf) that  shows that 92.1% Muslim women want this biased system of verbal triple talaq to stop.\n5. The Supreme Court asked the government of it\'s views. This was unfair as there should be no need for this and I think SC was being a coward.\n6. The govt. replied that it does not support the law.\n\nSo, my question to you is how is this in anyway shape or from related to BJP\'s view of Hindu Divorces? I do not support their views on that (Hindu Divorce, Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage) matter but that is not the question at hand. Why are you involving the BJP in this? It did not file the case. It did not ask the SC to take a look at ""arbitrary divorces"" among Muslims. It was not the primary driving force behind the case. You seem to be deliberately mixing UCC, which is not what this case is about, and Triple Talaq for your own reasons. If UCC comes in, polygyny and Triple Talaq will probably go away but we do not know the contents of the Law are going to be. It has not even been tabled in the parliament, so why are we fighting over that?', "">1) Talaq e Tafweez - Delegated divorce. The wife demands right of divorce when getting married. If this right is included in the marriage contract, then she can issue divorce just like triple talaq. Only thing is that it's not included by default.\n\nit should be included by default. will men allow it to be included by default? i'm OK with triple talaaq as long as everyone has the right to exercise it. "", ""If you completely ignore any possible agenda hindutvavadis may have on triple talaq and UCC, ideally it should not be possible to divorce a woman with 3 whatsapp messages, and everyone should have an identical set of laws.\n\nYou have a point that Indian society has had a situation where women were stuck in abusive marriages because divorce is shunned. The thing is - while that's true, it's not directly related to triple talaq.\n\nAnd, can Indian muslim women do the equivalent of triple talaq to get rid of an abusive spouse ? If not I'm not sure I understand your argument."", '[MRW](http://imgur.com/Uj3avk7)\n\n> And what exactly is the other option? Not allowing divorce at all?', 'ITT: non muslims trying to debate with Muslims on topics in  islam when none of them even seen let alone read Quran or the Hadith in real life. \n', 'It is a feminist propaganda. Hindu families are getting broken because of laws like 498A. So many lives have been destroyed. Triple talaq provides a hassle free option for divorce. There is meher which is alimony for wife. It is a perfect law . Islamic laws are based on human nature and fundamental difference between man and woman. It can not be changed just because it is 2016.']"	2016-10-30 21:06:46	phelpme2

If yes, what change do you see? Can you provide some details?
If no, when do you expect to see the change?

I can list some of the problems I face on a daily basis.

* Huge traffic jams. Every single day. Horrible public transport.
* Huge amount of pollution and dust. Huge number of old vehicles, low grade fuel etc. contributing to the problem.
* Low quality/diluted fuel being sold in most pumps in the city.
* Waste disposal. Waste is disposed on roadside in most places. Just dumped all over the road.
* Water quality is horrible. Including that of drinking water sold here.
* Roads are horrible. Gutters, holes everywhere. Cows roaming around on roads, shitting all over the place. Trash all around.
* Police, traffic police, autowallahs, bus-conductors are in general corrupt or rude.

I do not see these problems here being solved in five or even ten years from now.

On a side-note, huge amounts of tax being collected. From fuel to vehicles to sales to service to income to property to tolls. Everything is heavily taxed.

This implies that there are fewer women in public spaces in Delhi than there are men, as less women head off to work each day.\n\nA report published in 2013 by Institute of Human Development also highlighted a stark difference in the average salaries of male and female casual workers in Delhi. In 2011-12, while men earned an average of Rs 265 per day, women earned only Rs 98 per day. A Delhi government study showed that the number of women casual workers fell in 2011-12 from 2004-05, for which one reason could be that they find it more difficult to afford the daily fares to and from work.”\n\nThe female labor participation rate is less than half the national average in Delhi.

Reports suggest that millions of lower income class people were severely hit by the move; while some struggled to feed their children, others -- daily wage workers -- struggled to get work to meet their daily expenses.

I don't even see what he is going to ban him for.

His terrorist statement is misrepresented.

Here is the full text.

>1.Every Muslim should be a terrorist 

>Every Muslim should be a terrorist. A terrorist is a person who causes terror. The moment a robber sees a policeman he is terrified. A policeman is a terrorist for the robber. Similarly every Muslim should be a terrorist for the antisocial elements of society, such as thieves, dacoits and rapists. Whenever such an anti-social element sees a Muslim, he should be terrified. It is true that the word 'terrorist' is generally used for a person who causes terror among the common people. But a true Muslim should only be a terrorist to selective people i.e. anti- social elements, and not to the common innocent people. In fact a Muslim should be a source of peace for innocent people. 

Now all the newspapers and media are only quoting a part of the speech - ""Every muslim should be a terrorist"" and are calling for his ban. 

Many non-muslims also attend his speeches. You will find a lot of hindus and christians attending his speeches and asking questions. I don't see him inciting violence against non-muslims and supporting terrorists. All his lectures are video taped and sold. His arguments are not good, but that is not enough to ban him.

I've listened to a few of his 'sermons' and all he does is spew nonsense. \n\nFor example, I remember one instance where an atheist born to Hindu parents asked him some question about Islam. Don't remember the context but he said that if you're an atheist, you're half-muslim because Hinduism has many gods and Islam has one. So this guy has taken the 'first step' towards the true religion by rejecting the Hindu gods. \n\nPersonally, I think Islam should own up to these terrorists who are using some passages of the Koran to spew hatred against other religions. Saying that these terrorists are not Muslims is not helpful (the first step to solve a problem is concede that there's one). The same can be said of every terrorist group formed out of a religious or racist motivation - Christians (Ku Klux Klan), Hindus (Orange Brigade) or the Buddhist terrorists in Myanmar (don't remember the name).

5d2f379e0d7aab7428fc63fd	Controversial	Non-Political	1	How about increasing diversity on this subreddit?	"Hi all,

I have been lurking on this subreddit for a few months now. I've enjoyed reading many great conversations and AMA's here. The Net Neutrality related threads were awesome. This is a rare, public Indian forum which has a good quality of debate.

But does anyone else feel that the demographics of the user base is limiting its quality? From the looks of it, the readers are overwhelmingly male and in their early to mid twenties. Considering the subreddit is titled /r/india and is probably the most active Indian sub, shouldn't we try to draw more people from different age groups, gender and backgrounds to this forum?

For example, the recent thread on a matrimonial ad had almost no female participation. Similarly, when issues of Indian history come up, it would be good to get the perspective of older Indians who have lived through those times. Great AMA's like Siddharth Varadarajan and Rajeev Chandrashekhar deserve a wider audience.

What do you think?"	https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/38yw6n/how_about_increasing_diversity_on_this_subreddit/	34	"['The thing though is, how do you manage to diversify the demographics? You cannot force people to sign up and Reddit in itself is not a social media site. So what would be the incentive to join? ', 'A female friend introduced me to reddit and this sub. We had fun going through some of the funny posts, the witty banter and interesting conversations. But we also saw lots of subtle misogynistic content, not just here but in a lot of other subs. Maybe it\'s due to the skewed gender ratio and people just assume this is an ""ol\' boys club"". One of the surest ways to turn a thread hostile is to mention this observation. \n\nEveryone assumes you\'re a guy and by mentioning that you\'re a female, you\'re either called an attention seeker or a liar. You can only read ""there are no grills on the internet"" and ""bitches be crazy"" so many times before it gets annoying. \n\nI\'m sorry this might have come off as a rant. Overall, yes there are other women here but they just don\'t make themselves known as often. ', '/r/India makes it difficult for female redditors to put in their opinion coz of the nature of the sub. And if you happen to mention that you are a girl, either you are showered with too much unwanted attention or you are called out for karma whoring. So most girls choose to stay anonymous with regards to their gender. ', ""Yes. But this is not going to happen. Reddit is difficult to operate  nd not really user friendly. On top of it, unlike Facebook and Twitter, it doesn't give you a platform to get social validation. \n\nThe women who are on Reddit don't like commenting here because the crowd is sexist. Anonymity gives a chance to people to harass online. "", ""Btw - there has been an uptick in sensible deeper posters who care about this sub. Don't let the downvotes fool you.
