It probably took one mason 4-5 days to hew one stone. The same can be easily done today, by hand, but most people would not want to pay that kind of money. You could get the stone cut by machine. You wouldn't need much cement or lime once the stone is squared and cut-just the joints between.\n\nYou can produce the same lime as was used in the construction of Ancient Delhi, or the many forts, quite easily. But it takes a lot of labor and effort.\n\nThe 2013 stairs took about a day to build and the main reason for the cement flaking off is probably the cement to sand ratio was off. Typical correct ratio would be 5:1 or 6:1 sand to cement. The contractor may have stolen cement and may have used 8:1. And people walking on it before it was set.\n\nEdit 1-Also the cement may not have been kept cool and hydrated with water during curing.

Investments are not made that sacrifice a little bit now to receive more for future generations.\n\nThat's not to say every staircase should be built to last millenia or longer. We are working with finite resources and every investment has an opportunity cost. Stonework is expensive.
